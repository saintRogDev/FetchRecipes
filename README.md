### Focus Areas: I had 3 focus areas when I approached this project
  1. Functionality
     - I focused on ensuring the app met all outlined requirements while maintaining testability and scalability by using protocols and dependency injection. This made the app modular, easy to test, and adaptable for future enhancements.
  2. Leveraging data in useful ways
     - I leveraged all available data to maximize its usefulness, ensuring it was presented in meaningful ways that aligned with user needs. This approach provided a richer, more insightful experience while showcasing the robustness of the dataset. 
  3. User experience
     - I designed a simple, intuitive UI that adheres to Appleâ€™s best practices prioritizing performance, clarity, and ease of interaction. Features like the line item swipe allow users to seamlessly access recipe viewing options from various ways. 

### Time Spent: I spent roughly 7.5 hours working on this project 
  - about 30 minutes of planning out architecture and a simple design
  -  2 hour creating the networking and caching layers
  -  2 hours on UI
  -  2 hours writtting tests
  -  1 hour misc code clean up manually testing features 

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?    
  1. simple networking layer that doesn't cover all request types, this was done to avoid over engineering and because it just wouldnt have been a good use of time for this particular project. 
  2. keeping the UI and feature set very simple and opening links externally. Embedding youtube videos and keeping the user in the app to increase user engagment, conversion rate, and app usage time. Adding a sort and filter feature would make the app easier to you also
  3. I did not add tests for the image cache, testing the networking layer took a little longer than I orignally anticipated
  4. Did not test dark mode support 

### Weakest Part of the Project: 
  - UI is pretty standard with nothing very exciting and holding the user in the app
  - additional features are lacking sorting, searching, filtering, favoriting, sharing, offline mode, etc.  
  - Lacks accesibilty and localization
